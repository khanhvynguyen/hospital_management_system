# Hospital Management System

The primary objective of this project was to design and create a relational database that can manage various activities of a hospital. This system will enable hospital managers to understand the current patterns of faculty, keep track of all patients, medical records, treatment provided, prescription, and the use of medicine and other medical supplies. By reducing the time required to manage medical records, maintaining faculty and patient details, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health and welfare services, this system will help to enhance the quality of care provided by the hospital.

We populated our dataset with the information of faculty (doctors and nurses), patients, medical records, and medicine to analyze and generate the insights about health records, staff, medicine management and other activities of the hospital. To create our sample database, we generated 14 different datasets, and analyzed them to ensure compatibility with the proposed model.

We created EER and UML diagrams to model the conceptual structure of the database and mapped it to a relational model using the required primary and foreign keys. This database was implemented in MySQL and MongoDB to study its feasibility in a NoSQL environment. The database can then be accessed and manipulated by connecting it to Python, allowing further and extensive analysis, as demonstrated in the report.
